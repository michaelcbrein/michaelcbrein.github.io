## A Bit About Me

I’m Mike. I’m Rowan University graduate with a bachelor’s degree in geography with a minor in geographic information systems and urban planning. I am interested in philosophy, politics, economics, critical theory, labor, technology, and environmental studies.

I am currently working as a temporary full-time GIS Specialist at the NJ Department of Environmental Protection, and as a part-time GIS Specialist on a project called NJ Municipal Asset Provider (NJ MAP) NJ MAP a suite of web map products with the goal of informing planning and conservation efforts with real time GIS data.

I aim to provide GIS and data support to sustainable planning and policy making in the United States. Most of my interest lies in reducing waste production and energy consumption, expanding public transportation and walking and biking infrastructure, and improving the living conditions of poor and working people.

Outside of the work I do, I enjoy playing guitar, attending concerts, hiking, and exploring cities.
